# COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL

- To prepare data, Retrieve relevant data fields such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population from the dataset.
- Filter out duplicate values and clean the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for further analysis.

- To Analyze Total Cases vs Total Deaths,Compare total cases and total deaths for a specific location, such as India, to calculate the percentage of deaths relative to total cases over time.

- To Analyze Total Cases vs Population, Evaluate the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 by comparing total cases to the population of a specific location, such as India, over time.

- For Identify Countries with Highest Death Counts countries with the highest total death count by excluding irrelevant locations and summing up new deaths for each location.

-  Assess the Infection Rate compared to Population,Determine countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population by calculating the percentage of population infected with COVID-19.

- For Calculate Death Count per Population, Determine countries with the highest death count per population by summing up total deaths and grouping them by location.

- To Visualize Vaccination Progress,Create a view to store data for later visualizations, such as the percentage of population vaccinated over time, by joining COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data.

# COVID-19 Data Analysis using Excel

- Utilize Excel to clean raw COVID-19 data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.

- Apply Excel's built-in functions and features for data cleansing, such as removing special characters, correcting data types, and standardizing formats.
